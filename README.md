Most travel websites only give you prices on flights and hotels. When you want to plan for events or food, you have to rely on additional websites to help you navigate to the best activities or restaurants upon arrival at your vacation destination. Well, there is a solution for that with our website "A Getaway". 

Our website allows the user to search for the lowest price based on user's departure, arrival and date inputs. It will search for the trendiest, and top activities in the area so you don't have to do additional searching. It will also display the best restaurants in the area according to Yelp. You can even save your search so if you change you mind, you can still retrieve it.

Features:
1. Retrieve the lowest price for airline tickets based on user's departure, arrival and date inputs from Skyscanner API
2. Collect data from Yelp to display the best activities in the arrival city.
3. Collect data from Yelp to display the best restaurants in the arrival city.
4. Display review stars, address, links of the corresponding search
5. User can save the search to their favorite to retrieve later even after the page is refreshed.
